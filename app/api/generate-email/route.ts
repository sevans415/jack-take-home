I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention several requirements that need review and clarification regarding our current project submission.

After careful review of the specifications and submitted materials, we have identified ${
      items.length
    } requirement${items.length !== 1 ? "s" : ""} that need to be addressed:

${items
  .map((item: any, index: number) => {
    const productsList = item.products
      .map((product: any) => {
        let productNote = product.note ? ` - ${product.note}` : "";
        return `   â€¢ ${product.productName}${productNote}`;
      })
      .join("\n");

    return `${index + 1}. ${item.requirement}
   Article: ${item.articleName}
   Affected Products:
${productsList}
   ${item.note ? `Additional Notes: ${item.note}` : ""}`;
  })
  .join("\n\n")}

These requirements have been flagged during our compliance review process. We would appreciate your prompt attention to these matters to ensure the project remains on schedule and meets all specified requirements.

Please review the attached documentation and provide your response at your earliest convenience. If you have any questions or need additional clarification on any of these items, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
