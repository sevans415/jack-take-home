    // Create the prompt for Anthropic

Context:
- Project: Fixed Louvers installation
- Submittal includes: Wind-Driven Rain Resistant Louvers (EHH-501) and Standard Blade Louvers (ESD-435) by Greenheck
- Subcontractor: LOUVERS 'R US, INC.
- You are writing to: ${recipientNames} (${recipientType})
- Number of items needing attention: ${items.length}

Items requiring attention:
${itemsContext}

Key points to address:
1. Non-compliant items (${nonCompliantItems.length}): These don't meet specifications and need correction
2. Bookmarked items (${bookmarkedItems.length}): These need clarification or have questions
3. Unclear items (${unclearItems.length}): These need additional information

IMPORTANT: Pay special attention to the "User Note/Question" fields - these contain the specific questions or clarifications needed from the recipient.

Generate a professional email that:
1. Opens with a brief summary of what you're reviewing and why you're writing
2. If there are non-compliant items, list them first as they're most urgent
3. Convert user notes/questions into clear ACTION ITEMS (don't create a separate section listing the issues first, jump straight to action items)
4. Be specific about what needs to be done and by when
5. Maintains a professional but friendly tone
6. Closes with next steps and timeline expectations
7. If writing to a subcontractor, be direct about what needs to be corrected in the submittal
8. If writing to an architect, focus on clarification questions and acceptable alternatives

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use PLAIN TEXT ONLY
- DO NOT use any markdown formatting (no **, no *, no #, no backticks)
- DO NOT use markdown bold or italic markers
- Use "ACTION ITEMS:" or similar headers in ALL CAPS
- Use simple dashes (-) for bullet points
- Use line breaks for spacing
- Keep it clean and scannable

Also generate an appropriate subject line that summarizes the key issues (also plain text, no markdown).

Respond in JSON format with two fields:
{
  "subject": "plain text subject line here",
  "body": "plain text email body here"
}`;

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention several requirements that need review and clarification regarding our Fixed Louvers submittal.

After careful review of the specifications and submitted materials, we have identified ${
      items.length
    } requirement${items.length !== 1 ? "s" : ""} that need to be addressed:

${items
  .map((item: any, index: number) => {
    const productsList = item.products
      .map((product: any) => {
        let productNote = product.note ? ` - ${product.note}` : "";
        return `   â€¢ ${product.productName}${productNote}`;
      })
      .join("\n");

    return `${index + 1}. ${item.requirement}
   Article: ${item.articleName}
   Affected Products:
${productsList}
   ${item.note ? `Additional Notes: ${item.note}` : ""}`;
  })
  .join("\n\n")}

These requirements have been flagged during our compliance review process. We would appreciate your prompt attention to these matters to ensure the project remains on schedule and meets all specified requirements.

Please review the attached documentation and provide your response at your earliest convenience. If you have any questions or need additional clarification on any of these items, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Title]
[Your Company]`;
